# __*Lab 2*__

### Objective
Our objective for this lab was to create two of the major sensors for our robots. The first sensor was a microphone circuit, which should be able to detect a 660Hz sound, which will eventually trigger the robot to begin its task. The other sensor is an optical circuit using a phototransistor, which should be able to detect a 7 kHz IR signal. The major key in this experiment was to be able to amplify and filter the circuits in such a way that the signals would be strong enough to be detected, and only the desired frequencies would be detected.

### Work Distribution
Since this lab was split into two major parts, we split into two teams. The acoustic team consisted of Adam, Kelsey, and David, while the optical team consisted of Rajiv, Aaron, and Christina.

### Lab Documentation

#### Materials
We found the materials needed for this lab
*
*
*
* Breadboard
* Resistors
* Wires
* Capacitors
* LM324N OpAmp
* Multimeter
* Oscilloscope
* Power Supply
* Arduino Uno
* Phototransistor
* Treasure Board

### Optical Team

#### Designing the filters
We began by reading the the signal from the treasure board onto the oscilloscope, to get a sense of what the signal be need to be detecting is. We adjusted the trasure's frequency oscilloscope's sensitivity and range until we got the reading shown below:
