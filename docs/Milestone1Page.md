# __*Milestone 1*__

### Objective
The objective of this milestone was to add line-following and turn functionality to our robot. More specifically, this entailed correctly implementing two "inner" line sensors (for line-following functionality) and two "outer" line sensors (for detecting intersections and turn functionality). Ultimately, these two core functionalities were combined, allowing our robot to move in a figure eight path.

### Work Distribution
The entire team worked on this milestone. While the acoustic team for Lab 2 -- Adam, Kelsey, and David -- finished up Lab 2, the optical team -- Rajiv, Aaron, and Christina -- was responsible for the documentation of this milestone.

### Lab Documentation

#### Materials
* Line sensors
* 3-pin headers
* Wires

#### Line-Following
We first connected all four line sensors to the Uno by soldering headers to each of the sensors and then connecting the headers to the board with wires. Once the line sensors were connected, we tested them (i.e. "rolled" over black tape on white paper several times) in order to obtain approximate threshold values above which our robot would be told to register the color black and below which our robot would be told to register the color white.
