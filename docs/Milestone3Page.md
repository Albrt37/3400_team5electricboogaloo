# __*Milestone 3*__

### Objective
The objective of this milestone was to implement a path-traversing algorithm to facilitate maze exploration. This involved first running our algorithm in a simulation and then running our algorithm on our robot. In both the simulation and the real-life simulation, there is an indicator for when maze exploration is complete.

### Work Distribution
The entire team developed and debugged the algorithm together.
