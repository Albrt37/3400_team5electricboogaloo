# __*Lab 1*__

### Objective
Our objective, for this lab, was to get an introduction to using the Ardunio Uno and the Arduino IDE by creating a couple basic programs that performed simple functions. We were also tasked with assembling our robot and having it perform a simple autonomou task.

[Here's a video of the simple "Blink" program using the analog inputs of the Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fyEXJ2TXzA)
