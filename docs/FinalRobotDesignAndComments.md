# __*Final Comments on Robot*__

### Design

#### Potential Flaws

### Simulation vs. Experimental Results
  When running simulatons on the final design, we didn't have to actually send the data detected by the robot to the base station, and everything ran smoothly. When we started testing the radio control with the treasure sensors, it significantly slowed down performance to a point where the robot noticeably stopped for a couple seconds at each intersection in order to transmit data about the robot's location and surroundings.
  In theory, our treasure sensors should have worked fine, according tro our transfer function for our bandpass filter during lab 2, but when we tested it we detected interference from the wall sensors, and therefore had to adjust the design to turn off the wall sensor when searching for treasure.
