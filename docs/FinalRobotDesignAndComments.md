# __*Final Comments on Robot*__

### Design
#### The Physical Design
We decided to stick the orginal design from the beginning of the class and simply build from there. we had an ordinary chassis, midsize wheels with rubber grip for better traction, a section underneath the base for the power bank, a ball bearing for stability, and we added a second layer to provide us with space to wire our circuit. We passed most of our wires through different openings in our top level chassis. We tried to keep the wires relatively organized and typically kept all ground and power wires, black and red, respectively. This helped keep the area around the actual Arduino Uno less cluttered. On the top of our robot, we also included two 9 Volt batteries responsible for powering the rails of our robot, so that we could have a negative reference for certain circuits we included for treasure detection and possible filtering for the microphone. Our wall and treasure sensors were placed on the front, left, and right sides of the robot. Lastly, we used 3 line sensors, two to keep our robot on the lines and one slightly displaced to notify us of intersections. We also created an actual base station by velcroing a breadboard, our second Arduino, and our FPGA for ease of use in transporting the base station and keeping everything together.

#### Algorithms and Display

#### Potential Flaws in Design

### Simulation vs. Experimental Results
Hard to test in different environments because they always affect thresholds whereas in simulations those things can be held conststant.

### The Final Competition

### Conclusions
Our robot was built without having to purchase any parts not already found in lab, so we used $0 of our $100 budget.

#### Suggestions for Future Improvements
* Solder working circuit, so there will be no chances of wires popping out. This can save a lot of time when testing.
